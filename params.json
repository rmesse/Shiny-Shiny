{"name":"Shiny! Shiny!","tagline":"Simple and secure text-editing on Chrome","body":"# Shiny! Shiny!\r\n\r\n##Overview\r\nShiny! Shiny! is a very simple text authoring app for Chrome. It is designed around the '[Ace](https://ace.c9.io)' editor. It is ideal for use in educational environments (e.g. Exams) where a full screen text editor is required, without the distraction of a web-browser (when used in 'kiosk' mode).\r\n\r\nIt has a number of simple features (saving, opening, printing) that are detailed in the INSTRUCTIONS file (available from the App by pressing 'CTRL-?|/').\r\n\r\n##Usage\r\nYou can download the code yourself for modification/testing/usage/debugging or grab it from the [Google Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/).\r\n\r\n##Naming\r\nIronically named for it's minimalistic approach. Sometimes simple solutions are best.\r\n\r\n##Licensing\r\nIt is licensed under version 2.0 of the Apache License and contains code (thanks!) from the following projects (any alterations or modifications are marked in the code):\r\n\r\n|File|From|Copyright|License|\r\n|---|---|---|---|\r\n|jquery-2.2.0.min.js|[Website](http://jquery.org)|Copyright 2005, 2016 jQuery Foundation, Inc.|MIT License|\r\n|Markdown.Convertor.js|[Website](https://code.google.com/p/pagedown/)|Copyright 2004-2014 Various|[MIT License](https://code.google.com/p/pagedown/source/browse/LICENSE.txt)|\r\n|ace/*|[Website](https://ace.c9.io)|Copyright 2010, Ajax.org B.V.|[Revised BSD License](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/blob/master/LICENSE)|\r\n\r\nAll else, __Copyright JD, 2014-2016__.","google":"UA-53673057-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
